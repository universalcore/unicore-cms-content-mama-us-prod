This is because, as her stomach fills up with milk, her bowels get stimulated.\r\n\r\nBreastfed babies usually have yellowish bowel movements which smell sweet, and they tend to be soft. After they reach 1 month old, most babies have 1 or 2 bowel movements a day.\r\n\r\nYour baby\u2019s bowel movements may change at 6 months when she starts solid food. But bowel movements will settle down once your baby gets used to her new food. \r\n\r\nSo, notice your baby's bowel movements. If your baby has smelly, watery and mucus-streaked bowel movements more often, has a fever or seems to be losing weight, then your baby probably has diarrhea. Take her to a healthcare provider.\r\n\r\n[Diarrhea in babies][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/0_diarrhea-in-babies_82.bc",
