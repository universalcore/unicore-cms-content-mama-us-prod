It can stop the baby\u2019s head and brain growing normally. The baby may be born with a very small head (microcephaly). It may have other problems.\r\n\r\nThe mosquito that carries Zika usually bites in the day. Try not to get bitten. Here are some ideas:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWear clothes that cover your skin. Mosquitoes are attracted to dark colors. Wear light-colored clothes.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUse insect repellents on your skin. Ask at the pharmacy which ones to use. Or look for one that contains DEET, picaridin, or IR3535. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tUse a net. Sleep and rest under an insecticide-treated mosquito net. Use it in the day and at night, even in hot weather. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tTuck the net around you. If it has holes, patch them with fabric. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tDump standing water in your vicinity and seal trash in plastic bags. Mosquitoes are found near water and trash. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tKeep mosquitoes out of the building. Use screens and nets in windows and doors. Keep windows and doors closed.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tStay in air conditioned places, to avoid any chance of contact with a Zika-carrying mosquito\r\n\r\nIf you think you may have been bitten, or have Zika, go to the healthcare provider. \r\n\r\n\r\n[4 ways moms can cope with zika stress][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://blogs.babycenter.com/mom_stories/4-ways-moms-can-cope-with-zika-stress/",
