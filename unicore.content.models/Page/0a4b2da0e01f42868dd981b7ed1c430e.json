Dangling cords or plants may tempt him to reach up and pull things over on himself.\r\n\r\nPut purses and shopping up high so he cannot reach them. Even simple everyday things like lipstick and make-up can harm him.\r\n\r\nMake sure that medicines and tablets are out of his reach.\r\n\r\nKeep him away from laundry areas, where washing powders and other dangerous chemicals cold fall within his reach, and dirty washing.\r\n\r\n[Childproofing around the house][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/0_childproofing-around-the-house_460.bc",
