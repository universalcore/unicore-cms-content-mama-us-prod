  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nMost babies are born in month 9. But sometimes a baby comes early. If you go into labor early, you must to go to your birth center or hospital. Your baby will need extra care at the birth. If your baby is small and weak you may have to stay at the hospital until he gets stronger.\r\n\r\nGiving your baby breastmilk is one of the best things you can do to build up his  health. The first milk you make is very thick, creamy and full of goodness. Give your baby this precious gift.\r\n\r\nA baby who is born early may not be strong enough to feed at your breast. If you are in a hospital, your baby will be fed through a tube so that he gets as much nourishment as possible. \r\n\r\nThe hospital staff will help you to pump milk so that this can be fed to your baby. As soon as he starts to gain enough weight, you\u2019ll be able to nurse him. \r\n\r\nYour baby will also need lots of warmth. This will comfort him, help you both bond, and will also help him to develop. It will also help you to produce breastmilk.\r\n",
