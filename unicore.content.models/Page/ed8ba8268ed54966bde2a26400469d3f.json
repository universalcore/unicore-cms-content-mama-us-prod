Dehydrated means that her body does not have enough water to keep going. Keep offering your breast and let her feed as often as she wants.\r\n\r\nDo not give your baby any fruit juice, cola or sugary drinks. These drinks can make  diarrhea worse.\r\nIf your baby is younger than 6 months, she does not need any water. Breastmilk will give her all she needs.\r\n\r\nIf your baby is older than 6 months, give her small sips of cooled, boiled water between feedings. \r\nTake your baby to a health provider as soon as possible if:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tshe has diarrhea  for more than 1 day\r\n\r\n\u2022\tshe has dry skin or lips\r\n\r\n\u2022\ther urine is dark yellow and she is urinating less often\r\n\r\n\u2022\tthe soft spot in her head is sunken\r\n\r\n\u2022\tshe refuses to drink, has blood in her bowel movements or has a swollen tummy\r\n\r\n\u2022\tshe vomits for more than a day, or has a fever which lasts more than a day.\r\n\r\n[Diarrhea in babies][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/0_diarrhea-in-babies_82.bc",
