  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIf your baby has diarrhoea, she needs to replace the fluids she is losing, or she will get dehydrated. Dehydrated means that her body does not have enough water to keep going. Keep offering your breast and let her feed as often as she wants.\r\n\r\nDo not give her any fruit juice, cola or sugary drinks. These drinks can make diarrhoea worse.\r\n\r\nIf she is younger than 6 months, she does not need any water. Breastmilk will give her all she needs.\r\n\r\nIf she is older than 6 months, give her small sips of agua potable or boiled water between feeds. If you can, try giving her sips of vida suero oral, a few times an hour. Vida suero oral is dissolved in a litre of agua potable or boiled, cooled water. You can store this and use it over 8-12 hours. Give your baby 15-20 teaspoons of vida suero oral after each loose stool. Spread the teaspoons out over half an hour. Your local clinic may give you vida suero oral.\r\n\r\nTake your baby to a health worker as soon as possible if:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tshe has diarrhoea for more than 1 day\r\n\r\n\u2022\tshe has dry skin or lips\r\n\r\n\u2022\ther urine is dark yellow and she is urinating less often\r\n\r\n\u2022\tthe soft spot in her head is sunken\r\n\r\n\u2022\tshe refuses to drink, has blood in her stools or has a swollen tummy\r\n\r\n\u2022\tshe vomits for more than a day, or has a fever which lasts more than a day.\r\n",
