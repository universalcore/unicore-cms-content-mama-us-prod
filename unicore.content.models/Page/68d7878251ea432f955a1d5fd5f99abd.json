You will be able to see her swallow while she is feeding, and your breasts will feel emptier and softer after feedings.\r\n\r\nAnother good sign is if your baby changes rhythm while sucking and pauses during feedings. She should start feeding again when she is ready, and come off your breast when she wants to.\r\n\r\nYour baby's diapers can also show if your baby is getting enough milk. Bowel movements should be a yellow color and should be passed at least once a day. When you change your baby\u2019s diaper, her urine should be pale and should have no smell. Your baby should have at least 6 to 8 wet diapers every day.\r\n\r\nA baby who gets enough milk will also have firm, healthy colored skin that bounces back when lightly pinched.\r\n\r\nIf you are worried that your baby is not getting enough milk, ask a healthcare provider. They will be able to check that your baby is healthy.\r\n\r\n[Signs your breastfed baby is eating enough][1]\r\n\r\n[How to tell your baby's getting enough milk][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/2_signs-your-breastfed-baby-is-eating-enough_10379819.bc\r\n  [2]: http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-tell-whether-your-babys-getting-enough-breast-milk_617.bc",
