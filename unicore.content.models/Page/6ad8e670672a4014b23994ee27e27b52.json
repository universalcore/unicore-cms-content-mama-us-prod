Some feel just a bit nauseated in the morning, and some find certain smells make them feel nauseated all day. Most women feel better by 3 months, but it could last longer. \r\n\r\nTry changing what you eat. Choose foods without much fat, and with no strong smell or taste. You could avoid spicy food, too. Some women find they can eat cold food but not hot food.\r\n\r\nIf you feel nauseated mostly in the mornings, it might help if you eat some crackers before you get up. \r\n\r\nAlso, try eating small meals, but more often.\r\n\r\nSome ginger tea or even just the smell of freshly grated ginger or lemon can help. \r\n\r\nExplain to your family and friends how you are feeling and what you need. \r\n\r\nFeeling nauseated and vomiting is normal in pregnancy, but if you are vomiting many times a day, if you are unable to eat and drink without vomiting, and if you are losing weight, you may need treatment by a healthcare provider.\r\n\r\n[Morning sickness: Causes, concerns, treatments][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/morning-sickness",
