This will help. Explain to other people what effect their smoking will have on your baby growing inside you. \r\n\r\nIf you live in a cold area where opening doors and windows is not possible, try to stay in the least smoky part of the house. \r\n\r\nAsk family and friends to smoke outside. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
