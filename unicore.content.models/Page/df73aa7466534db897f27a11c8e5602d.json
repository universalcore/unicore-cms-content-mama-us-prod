Babies cannot adjust to the new, cooler, temperature outside the womb, and can lose heat very quickly. \r\n\r\nWhen your baby is born, he will be wet, so make sure your baby is dried. \r\n\r\nHe does not need to be bathed for at least 6 hours. For the first 6 hours of your baby's life, clean only the cord. The rest of his body does not need to be bathed. Bathing your baby too soon could make him sick and cold.\r\n\r\nAsk your birth attendant to lay your baby on your bare chest. Your warmth will help prevent him from getting too cold. Hold him firmly so he does not slip and fall.\r\n\r\nLay a clean, warm blanket over both of you. This will keep the heat in. Also put a small hat or a cloth wrapper over his head. Babies lose a lot of heat through their heads. \r\n\r\nKeeping your baby warm through skin-to-skin contact will also give you and your baby time to get to know each other. You can see who has been kicking you all this time! Holding your baby this way means your baby can easily reach your breast and start feeding. \r\n\r\n[How to keep my baby warm at night without blankets?][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/404_how-can-i-keep-my-baby-warm-at-night-without-blankets_7648.bc",
