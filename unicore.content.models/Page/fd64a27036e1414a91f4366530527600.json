Try to make the first visit for just after you missed your period. \r\n\r\nHere is why regular check-ups make sense:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAt the check-up, a doctor or midwife will do tests to make sure that you and your baby are well. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tIf there are problems when you are pregnant, your doctor will find them early. This will give you the best chance of getting the right treatment so you and your baby are healthy.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIf you have questions about your pregnancy, your health worker is the best person to ask. She will answer your questions and will give you the right information.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tYou will feel reassured your baby is growing well.\r\n\r\nFind out how to get to your nearest doctor or to your local hospital or clinic. Talk to your family about why you need to visit regularly during pregnancy. Ask them for help if you need transport. \r\n\r\nIf you are worried, ask the father of your baby or another family member, or a trusted friend to go with you. If it is a long way, you may want to carry some food and drinking water with you.\r\n",
