It is best to have at least 5 visits while you are pregnant. Try to schedule the first visit just after you have missed your period. \r\n\r\nHere is why regular checkups make sense:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAt the checkup, a healthcare provider will do tests to make sure that you and your baby are well.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIf there are problems when you are pregnant, your healthcare provider will find them early. This will give you the best chance of getting the right treatment so you and your baby are healthy.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIf you have questions about your pregnancy, your healthcare provider is the best person to ask. She will answer your questions and will give you the right information.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tYou will feel reassured your baby is growing well.\r\n\r\nFind out how to get to your nearest healthcare provider or to your local hospital or birth center. Talk to your family about why you need to visit regularly during pregnancy. Ask them for help if you need transportation. \r\n\r\nIf you are worried, ask the father of your baby or another family member, or a trusted friend to go with you. If it is a long way, you may want to carry some food and drinking water with you.\r\n\r\n[What to expect at your prenatal visits][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/0_what-to-expect-at-your-prenatal-visits_9252.bc",
