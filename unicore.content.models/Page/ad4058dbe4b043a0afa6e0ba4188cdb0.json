This reduces the risk of her falling over. Once she is in this position, put a favorite toy in front of her. Place pillows or blankets around her, so that she does not get hurt if she falls. Stay nearby and watch her.\r\n\r\nYou could also encourage your baby to play lying on her belly. Lifting her head and chest to see a toy will help her strengthen her neck muscles and develop the head control she needs for sitting up. You can help her strengthen her legs by standing her on your thighs and bouncing her up and down. This will probably make her giggle!\r\n\r\nBy the time she is 8 months old, she should be able to sit well without support.\r\n\r\n",
