Make sure you tell staff at the hospital that you are HIV positive. You need extra care in labor to prevent the HIV virus being passed to your baby. \r\n\r\nWhen your baby is here, your healthcare providers will advise you on the best way to feed him. \r\n\r\nYour baby needs a daily dose of ARV syrup for 4 to 6 weeks after the birth, to protect him from HIV. Your baby will need blood tests soon after he is born to check if the HIV virus has passed to him .\r\n\r\nMake sure you touch your baby with clean hands. Cover all cuts and wounds with a bandage until they heal. \r\n\r\nHIV is a long-term illness. With the right medicines, you can manage and control it. \r\n\r\n",
