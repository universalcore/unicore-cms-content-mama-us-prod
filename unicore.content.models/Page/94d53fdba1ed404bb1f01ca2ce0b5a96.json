And while your body is going through all these changes, your emotions may be in turmoil, too. \r\n\r\nAllow yourself to feel what you feel. Pregnancy loss is an emotional time. Some people grieve for the loss as they would for a close relative or friend. We all grieve, and it can affect your mind and body in different ways. Or you may feel relieved for many reasons.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tRemember that early pregnancy loss is common. It is very unlikely to have happened because of anything you did or did not do.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tYou might feel angry with those close to you or toward friends or other members of the family who are pregnant or who have had a baby. You might feel overwhelming sorrow. It may seem that everything you had hoped for has been taken away instantly. You may feel exhausted, but unable to sleep. Your everyday routine may seem meaningless. You may not want to eat, or find it hard to concentrate. Or you may feel none of these things. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tRemember - you do not have to hide your feelings. Sharing your feelings with friends and family will help you.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWe wish you the best of luck in the future.\r\n",
