This blood loss may make you feel dizzy, sweaty or faint.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why you might be losing too much blood.\r\n\r\nAfter birth, the womb usually shuts off the blood vessels that took blood through to the baby. If this does not happen, the blood vessels leak into the womb and cause heavy bleeding.\r\n\r\nSometimes the placenta does not come away cleanly, and this, too, can cause heavy bleeding. \r\n\r\nA healthcare provider can help to stop the flow of blood. You may be given an injection or tablets to take. You may also need extra fluid through an IV drip to replace what you have lost. Get help from a healthcare provider as soon as you see heavy or bright red blood.\r\n\r\nYou will need lots of rest when you get home. Ask your family and friends for help.\r\n\r\nIf you have any medicines to take, finish them even if you feel better. This will help you to recover.\r\n\r\n",
