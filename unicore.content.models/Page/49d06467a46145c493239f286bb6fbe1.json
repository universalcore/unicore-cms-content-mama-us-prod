  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nSome women want to keep their pregnancy a secret at first. \r\n\r\nBut telling a doctor or midwife does not mean you have to tell everyone else. \r\n\r\nTalking about being pregnant with a doctor or midwife will be good for you and your baby. It will mean fewer problems if you get the right care early on.\r\n\r\n You can have tests to make sure that you and your baby are healthy. You can have blood and urine tests, and tests for HIV. If the test for HIV is not offered, you can ask for one.\r\n\r\nIf you know you are living with HIV, you may be able to have free medication to prevent your baby from becoming HIV+. Ask your doctor or call TELSIDA 01800-712-0889, to find your nearest clinic.\r\n\r\nEven if you feel well, get regular check-ups so that you and your baby can stay healthy.\r\n",
