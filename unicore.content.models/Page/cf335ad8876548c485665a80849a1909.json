If it does not, soak the penis in warm water, and gently unwrap the bandage. Apply antiseptic if the medical staff gave it to you. If not, petroleum jelly can protect the wound from germs.\r\n\r\nThere may be some blood on your baby boy's nappy for a few hours after the procedure. Keep the nappy area clean. Wash his penis gently with agua limpia y libre de contaminaci\u00f3n and mild soap 3 times a day.\r\n\r\nChange his nappy as soon as it gets wet, to avoid infection. You can also give him some nappy-free time. Fresh air will help the wound to dry. Dressing your baby boy in loose clothing also helps the healing process.\r\n\r\nYour baby boy may feel some pain. Give him a painkiller if the doctor prescribed it. Offer him your breast to comfort him.\r\n\r\nThe wound should heal within 1 or 2 weeks. Take him to the clinic or hospital if his penis is red and swollen after 2 to 3 days, if he is still bleeding or if he is urinating less often than normal.\r\n",
