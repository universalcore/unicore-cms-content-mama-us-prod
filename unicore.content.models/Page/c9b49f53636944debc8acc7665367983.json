Stop mosquitoes breeding\r\n\r\nThe mosquito that carries Zika usually bites in the day.  \r\n\r\nIf you live in, or are travelling to countries where outbreaks of Zika have been reported, take these steps  to avoid getting bitten:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWear clothes that cover your skin. Mosquitoes are attracted to dark colors. Wear light-colored clothes.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUse insect repellents on your skin. Ask at the pharmacy which ones to use. Or look for one that contains DEET, picaridin, or IR3535. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tUse a net. Sleep and rest under an insecticide-treated mosquito net. Use it in the day and at night, even in hot weather. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tTuck the net around you. If it has holes, patch them with fabric. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tDump standing water in your vicinity and seal trash in plastic bags. Mosquitoes are found near water and trash. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tKeep mosquitoes out of the building. Use screens and nets in windows and doors. Keep windows and doors closed.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tStay in air conditioned places, to avoid any chance of contact with a Zika-carrying mosquito\r\n\r\nIn some places, agencies may spray to kill mosquitoes.  \r\n\r\nIf you are pregnant and think you may have Zika go to your healthcare provider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[7 ways to protect yourself from mosquitoes][1] \r\n\r\nPhoto Credit: \u00a9 CDC/Division of Vector-borne Diseases\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/101_7-ways-to-protect-yourself-from-mosquitoes_10412666.bc",
