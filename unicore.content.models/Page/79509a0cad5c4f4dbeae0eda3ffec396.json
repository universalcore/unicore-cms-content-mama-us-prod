It will stretch and open in labor. \r\n\r\nFirst, your cervix (the opening to your womb) has to shorten and soften. Feel your nose: it is firm. Now feel your lips: they are soft and stretchy. Your cervix starts out firm like your nose. In early labor, it becomes soft and stretchy like your lips. \r\n\r\nNext, your cervix starts to open and widen. You may not notice this starting. Your womb may be contracting very gently. It might feel like the cramps you get with your menstrual period.\r\n\r\nAs time passes, you will get increasingly painful contractions. They will start to come regularly. \r\n\r\nEverybody's labor is different. But usually, early contractions are more than 5 minutes apart and short, perhaps only 30 or 40 seconds long. They will not bother you much yet. \r\n\r\nFor some women, early labor starts and stops. For others, it moves smoothly into full labor, which gets stronger until your baby is born. \r\n\r\n[Stages of labor][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/stages-of-labor",
