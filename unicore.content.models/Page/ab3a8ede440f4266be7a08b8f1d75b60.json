Infections are very dangerous to young babies. Keep the cord stump clean and dry.\r\n\r\nYour family may suggest that you put other substances on the stump to help it heal. Do not let them do this. It is dangerous. Explain that keeping it clean and dry is safest for your baby. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter washing your baby, simply pat the cord area dry with a clean towel.
