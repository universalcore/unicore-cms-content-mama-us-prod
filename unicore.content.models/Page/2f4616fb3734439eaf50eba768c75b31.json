Sex does not cause pregnancy loss.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you feel pain in your stomach, or you are bleeding, or you had problems in a previous pregnancy, talk to your healthcare provider first. It may be safer not to have sex until after your baby is born.\r\n\r\nYou may feel uncomfortable and may not want to have sex. Many women feel like that. Try to show love in other ways. Maybe just hold each other or give each other a massage.\r\n\r\nIf you are leaking sticky fluid (a discharge) or you are itching and you want to have sex, use a condom. It is safer. If you notice a discharge, you should also go to the healthcare provider when you can.\r\n \r\nIt is a good idea to use condoms always, while you are pregnant. They protect you and your baby against infections you can get from sex and from HIV.\r\n\r\nYou can get infections from having any type of sex with someone who has an infection.\r\n\r\nThese infections can make you and your baby very sick. A healthcare provider can test you for infections and will help you to manage them. Look for a rash around your vagina or pain when you urinate.\r\n\r\nRemember, you can have an infection with no symptoms. So it is a good idea to get tested.\r\n",
