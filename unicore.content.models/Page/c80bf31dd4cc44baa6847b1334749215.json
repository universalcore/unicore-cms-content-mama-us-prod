A baby who is ready to start solids can usually do these things:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShe holds her head up.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShe sits up well when supported. You may have to sit your baby on your lap at first.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShe makes chewing motions. Your baby should be able to move food to the back of her mouth and swallow.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShe is curious about what you are eating. When babies look at your food and stretch their hands out to it, this is a sign that they are ready to eat solid food.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tShe is a healthy weight. Most babies are ready to eat soft solids when they have doubled their birth weight. This is usually at about 6 months.\r\n\r\nYour baby may be showing these signs before 6 months. But it is safer if you wait until she is 6 months old before giving her mashed foods. By then her digestive system is stronger. This means there is less chance of her having a stomach problem or a bad reaction to food.\r\n",
