  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nThe best way to avoid having seizures in pregnancy is to check your blood pressure and urine regularly. You can get these tests from a health provider. \r\n\r\nHaving seizures in pregnancy is usually because of a condition called eclampsia. If you have a condition called pre-eclampsia, you need to see your healthcare provider often, so that you do not get eclampsia and seizures. \r\n\r\nYou might develop pre-eclampsia if your sister or mother had it. You are also more likely to get pre-eclampsia if you had high blood pressure before pregnancy or if you have diabetes.\r\n\r\nExperts think you get eclampsia because your body cannot carry the baby any longer. If this happens, go to the hospital.\r\n\r\nBlood pressure checks and urine tests can identify problems early. So the best way to avoid seizures is to see a health provider regularly for tests. Regular checks monitor your health and your body\u2019s ability to carry your baby inside you. \r\n\r\nSee a health provider, or go to the hospital immediately if:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tyou have blurred vision\r\n\r\n\u2022\tyou have a severe headache\r\n\r\n\u2022\tyour face, hands and feet begin to swell suddenly\r\n\r\nThese signs may mean you have pre-eclampsia, and you may have seizures if you do not get help quickly.\r\n\r\n",
