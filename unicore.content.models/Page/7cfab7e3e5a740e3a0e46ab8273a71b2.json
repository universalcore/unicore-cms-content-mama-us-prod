Add amaranto, ch\u00eda and peanuts to your food to make it even healthier. Fruits like mangoes, papayas and melon are good. Get lots of them. Try to have 1 extra handful of food with every meal. Do not go without food for too long. Carry some food, like fruit or some nuts, with you if you have to go somewhere.\r\n 2. **Get check-ups while you are pregnant**. Try to have at least 5 visits to your doctor or midwife. Get your blood and urine tests and blood pressure checks done regularly. These tests help to find problems early. Then you can get treatment and keep yourself and your baby safe. \r\n 4. **Get tested for HIV if you are worried**. If you are HIV+, there are medicines to help keep you well and prevent your baby from being born HIV+. If you find out you are not HIV+, you can make sure you stay that way.\r\n 5. **Take your pregnancy vitamins**. These vitamins help your baby to grow well. \r\n 6. **Keep clean**.
