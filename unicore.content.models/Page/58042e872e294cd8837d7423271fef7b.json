Try to eat a mixture of different colored foods every day and you will gain weight steadily as your baby grows.\r\n\r\nYou may find that your appetite changes throughout your pregnancy:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIn the first few weeks, your appetite may decrease and you may not feel like eating proper meals, especially if you are feeling nauseated or are vomiting.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tDuring the middle part of your pregnancy, your appetite may be the same as before you were pregnant or it may be slightly increased.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tTowards the end of your pregnancy, your appetite will probably increase. Eat fruit, vegetables, beans, nuts, eggs and meat. Explain to your family that you need more food to grow a healthy baby. \r\n\r\nAsk them if you can buy more of these foods. You need an extra handful of food with each meal. You may also need a small snack between meals.\r\n\r\n",
