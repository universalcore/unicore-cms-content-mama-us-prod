This will help to keep her safe. If you cannot clean the floor, put down a large, clean blanket or mat.\r\n\r\nAs she grows up, your baby may like to play outside but, in some areas, worms are a problem. Worms are picked up from the mud and soil, and can cause belly pain, coughing and fever.\r\n\r\nThick socks, slippers or shoes will help to protect your baby when she starts to walk outside. Wash her hands well with soap and agua limpia. It is also important to clean her nails regularly. This will stop worm eggs from the ground from entering her body when she puts her hands in her mouth.\r\n \r\nIf your child has a worm infection, you may not even know it. Deworming medicine kills any worms your child may have caught. This is safe for your child to take even if she has not caught any worms. Ask your doctor if your baby should take deworming medicine.\r\n",
