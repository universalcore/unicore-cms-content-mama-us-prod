Your bowel movements might also be unusually hard, lumpy, large or small.\r\n\r\nLots of women get constipated in pregnancy. It has different causes: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tAs your baby gets bigger, your womb presses down on your pelvic area. This makes constipation more likely.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPregnancy hormones can also slow the movement of food through your body. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tA lack of exercise can also slow your digestive system down.\r\n\r\nYou can help your body by eating more fruit and vegetables. Try dark green leafy vegetables like kale and spinach. Vegetables and fruit are high in fiber, which will help to make your  bowel movements softer and easier to pass. Beans and brown rice could help too. Drink plenty of clean water. This will also help to prevent constipation. \r\n\r\nIf you take iron tablets to prevent anemia, they can cause constipation. Do not stop taking the tablets, as they are very important for you and your baby\u2019s health. Instead, ask your healthcare provider for a different type of iron tablet and drink plenty of water, eat well and make sure you get some exercise every day.\r\n\r\n[Constipation during pregnancy][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/0_constipation-during-pregnancy_836.bc",
