  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes an operation is the safest way to have your baby. You can only have a caesarean, or c-section, at a hospital.\r\n \r\nYou may need a c-section if you are having more than 1 baby, or if your baby is not in a good position to be born. \r\n\r\nIf you have been in labor for more than 12 hours, you may need a c-section to help your baby be born. \r\n\r\nIf you are bleeding during labor, c-section may be needed very quickly.\r\n\r\nIf you had a c-section with a previous baby, you may need one with this baby as well. So make sure you plan to have your baby in a hospital.\r\n\r\nYou may be asleep while you have the c-section, or you may have an injection in your spine so you feel no pain. \r\n\r\nA cut is made in your belly. Your baby will be delivered by the practitioner and then you are stitched up again. You will see your baby as soon as she is born, or when you wake up if you have been asleep for the operation.\r\n\r\nAfter the c-section, you will need to be looked after for several days while the cut heals. You will bleed from your vagina for a few weeks, just as you would with a normal birth.\r\n\r\n[C-sections: Giving birth by cesarean section][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/0_c-sections-giving-birth-by-cesarean-section_160.bc",
