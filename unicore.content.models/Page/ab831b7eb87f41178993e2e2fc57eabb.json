Your body is very good at making milk, but if you do not eat enough you may feel tired and faint. \r\n\r\nTry to eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables like kale, spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, oranges, grapefruit and melon. Eating foods of a variety of colors so you get plenty of vitamins and minerals. \r\n\r\nEat energy-giving food like rice, corn and potato. Eat protein, found in eggs, beans, fish, poultry and meat. Try to have milk or nuts each day. Eat a good variety of foods, and your body will get all it needs to feed your baby well.\r\n\r\nTry to eat 3 main meals a day at regular times. Eat plenty of snacks throughout the day, to keep up your energy levels. Good snacks are dried fruit, nuts, fresh fruit and vegetables and seeds.\r\n\r\nBreastfeeding can make you feel thirsty. Have a drink of water before you feed your baby. You do not have to drink milk to make milk, but you do need to drink plenty of water. Do not drink too much coffee, cola or soda. Just 1 or 2 glasses of these a day is enough. \r\n\r\nIf you do not want to eat, it could be a sign that you need extra support. If it is a struggle to eat, and you are forcing yourself, talk to your healthcare provider.\r\n",
