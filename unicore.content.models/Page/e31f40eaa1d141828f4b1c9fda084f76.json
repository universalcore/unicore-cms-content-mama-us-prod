Take your baby boy to a doctor for a safe, clean circumcision. \r\n\r\nDoctors are trained to do the procedure in a quick and easy way. So it is less likely to cause problems. If something does go wrong, staff know what to do.\r\n\r\nStaff at the hospital also use clean tools. This will help to protect your baby boy from infections. Staff will also give him medicine to numb the pain. This will make him much more comfortable.\r\n\r\nFriends and family may tell you to get a religious or traditional leader to do the circumcision. But they may not have been trained and will not know how to keep germs away.\r\n\r\nTell your family and friends that getting your baby boy circumcised by a doctor is the safest way.\r\n",
