You will feel contractions again, but weaker this time.\r\n\r\nHold your new baby next to your skin. He will look for your breast to suck. Offer your breast as soon as possible. Breastfeeding like this will increase your contractions to make the placenta come out more easily. Sit upright to help your body to push the placenta out more easily.\r\n\r\nThe placenta, and the empty bag of waters, will drop to the bottom of your womb. They pass out through your vagina.\r\n\r\nHold your baby close to you. Holding him against your skin will help keep your baby warm, help him to breastfeed and help to reduce the amount you bleed.\r\n\r\nTake time to rest after the birth and get to know your baby. You will need some pads to soak up the bleeding. This will be heavy at first, like a very heavy period. It will settle down and become much lighter. Bleeding can continue for several weeks after your baby is born. \r\n\r\n[Bonding with your baby][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/baby-bonding",
