Sit facing him and offer some soft food on your clean finger or on a spoon. It may take him a while to know how to move the food around with his tongue and swallow it. Be patient. He will learn.\r\n\r\nGive him mashed food once a day to begin, then twice a day and then 3 times a day. Offer him breastmilk before and after the mashed food. \r\n\r\nYour baby's stools will change after eating food, getting darker and smellier. This is normal.\r\n\r\nWhen your baby starts to pick up things for himself, you will know this is the time to give him more filling foods. Try hard-boiled eggs, well-chopped fish, or meat or mashed peas and beans, or dry bread if he is teething. Do not add salt to your baby\u2019s food.\r\n\r\nNow he is moving around, your baby needs to eat 3 to 4 times a day. Give him snacks, as well as meals. His food must be soft, so he can mash it up with his tongue and swallow. Stay with him when he is eating, in case of choking.\r\n\r\nWash his hands with soap and water before he eats.\r\n\r\nFormula or breastmilk is still healthy for him, so feed him often. \r\n\r\nNow he is older, he can also have boiled water, but not cola, tea, coffee or sugary drinks.\r\n\r\n[Favorite first foods for babies][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.babycenter.com/101_favorite-first-foods-for-babies_10403314.bc",
