  "content": "Created by BabyCenter \r\n\r\n\r\nNow your baby in your womb looks like a tiny newborn baby. Her eyes, eyebrows and eyelids have developed and her teeth are growing under her gums. \r\n\r\nThe taste buds on her tongue are developing. She will be able to taste your milk from the first feeding. \r\n\r\nShe has a creamy white substance covering her skin. This protects your baby\u2019s skin and helps with the birth.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, you may begin to feel your baby's movements. It feels like tiny bubbles inside you. At first, you may not be sure what it is. \r\n\r\nGradually the movements become stronger and you can then be sure that it is your baby kicking. It is an exciting moment!\r\n\r\nYou could also start feeling breathless now and you may feel clumsy. This is because you are carrying more weight and your bump affects your balance.\r\n\r\nYou may have a heavier discharge and want to urinate more often.\r\n\r\nIf you notice some bleeding when you brush your teeth, it is because your pregnancy hormones are making your gums swell and become sore, which can lead to bleeding. Brush every day, but be gentle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
